## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

### Models

- `Restaurant`: Core data model with SwiftData
- `RestaurantResponse`: API response model

### Views

- `ContentView`: Main tab-based interface
- `RestaurantDetailView`: Detailed restaurant information
- `RestaurantMapView`: Interactive map view
- `SearchFiltersView`: Advanced search filters
- `RestaurantListItemView`: List item component

### ViewModels

- `SearchViewModel`: Handles search logic and filtering
- `RestaurantDataService`: Manages data fetching and storage
- `LocationManager`: Handles location services
- `BackgroundRefreshService`: Manages background data updates

## Data Source

The app fetches data from the official NYC Health Department:

- **Source**: https://a816-health.nyc.gov/ABCEatsRestaurants/#!/Search
- **API Endpoint**: https://a816-health.nyc.gov/ABCEatsRestaurants/api/restaurants

## Development Notes

### Mock Data

For development and testing, the app uses `MockDataService` which provides sample restaurant data. To switch to live data:

1. Replace `MockDataService()` with `RestaurantDataService()` in `ContentView.swift`
2. Ensure the NYC Health API is accessible

### Background Refresh

The background refresh functionality is configured but may require additional setup for production:

- Background app refresh must be enabled in iOS Settings
- The app must be backgrounded for background tasks to execute

### Data Storage

- Uses SwiftData for local storage
- Automatic data persistence
- Efficient querying and filtering

## Privacy & Permissions

- **Location**: Used to show nearby restaurants on the map
- **Background Processing**: Used for daily data refresh
- **Network**: Used to fetch restaurant data from NYC Health API
